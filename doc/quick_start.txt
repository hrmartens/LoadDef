The best way to get started with LoadDef is to work through the examples
in the `working' directory.

---

Before getting started, you will need to ensure that certain Python
libraries are properly installed. You may use a package-management system,
such as `Anaconda', or have a system administrator install the packages.

To install via Anaconda:

We recommend creating a dedicated environment for LoadDef. 

At the command line, run:
  conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
  conda config --set channel_priority strict
  conda create -n LDEF python=3.7 basemap mpi4py scipy netCDF4 pyshp shapely numba jupyter pygmt

To activate the new environment, run:
  conda activate LDEF

If the above activation does not work, please try:
  source activate LDEF

LoadDef should now be ready to use. To deactivate the new environment when you are finished, you may run:
  conda deactivate

--

You should be all set with the following if the Anaconda environment was created successfully:

Required packages to use the main features of LoadDef include:
NumPy
SciPy
math
sys
os
datetime
mpi4py
numba

Optional packages to take advantage of additional LoadDef features include:
mpl_toolkits.basemap
shapefile
shapely
pyproj
netCDF4

--

With the required packages installed, navigate to the LoadDef `working'
directory. Now, you are ready to compute Love numbers for PREM by typing:

mpirun -np 2 python run_ln.py

If you have lots of processors at your disposal, you can change the `2' 
to a larger number. 

The default will be to compute Love numbers from n=0 to n=10,000. The output
will be directed to a folder called `output' (created on the first run). 
Navigate up one directory from the `working' directory, and you should see
the new `output' directory listed there. 

---

Once the Love numbers have been computed, you are ready to compute
load Greens functions. Navigate back into the `working' directory, and type:

mpirun -np 2 python run_gf.py

The Greens functions will automatically start computing, and be 
directed to the `output' folder.

---

Love-number partial derivatives can be computed in a similar way:

mpirun -np 2 python run_pl.py

The output will appear in the `output' folder.

---

To compute load-induced surface displacements, a load model must first be
generated. The `GRDGEN/load_models/' folder contains multiple scripts for
converting standard load models into LoadDef format. 

For example, navigate to /input/Load_Models/TPXO8-Atlas/ and run the script
to download the M2 ocean tide model (note: you may need to email the authors
of the TPXO models now to download the data!). Next, go to /GRDGEN/load_files/ 
and run gen_otl.py. It is already set up to convert the TPXO8-Atlas model into
standard LoadDef format. If you are using a different ocean-tide model, you
can simply update the lines at the top of the script under "User Inputs". 

After a load model has been converted to LoadDef format, and load Greens 
functions have been computed, you are ready to compute surface displacements.
Navigate into the `working' folder, and modify the user parameters to reflect
the location and name of your load model and Greens function files. The script
is already set up for the TPXO8-Atlas example. 

Then, you are ready to run the program by typing:

mpirun -np 1 python run_cn.py

Here, it will NOT be an advantage to use more than 1 processor, UNLESS you 
have multiple load models to convolve for a single station. 

That's it! The output will be directed to the `output' folder.

More information on all of the examples listed above can be found in the
User Manual, which should have come with the software.
